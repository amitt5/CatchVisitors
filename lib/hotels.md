this is my app catchvisitors. its a small app where user can get a line of code which they can add to their site and have a voice bot which helps them convert visitros on their site. also I am thinknig of building a voice agent saas which connects with existing CRM and does out bound calling based on a given cireteria from the user
there are 2 startups ListenLabs and outset. both of them rasied 10s of millions in their latest round. what they do is basically user interviews using ai agents. while talking to user they also show them things on the screen (so user can respond to it).
so outset is combining visuals (web) to be shown to user with voice. 

I am thinking of a catchvisitor extended version. For hotels. so catch visitor gives you a simple voice bot on your site (based on scraped data + additional instructions) . what the extended version would do is hotel website visitor comes to hotel website and clicks on voice bot. voice bot opens a modal and starts talking. in the modal you can see(read) what bot is saying and then whatever visitors says is also transcribed in the modal - like a chat. and where ever necessary the visitor wil also see some media on the screen. for e.g. 
1) visitor asks what are places of interest near by - agent say thee is rembrandt plein 7 minutes walk, anne frank museum 12 minutes walk and while its saying there places, it also shows images of these place in like a slide show
2) visitor asks about the rooms - bot "shows" them the room
3) bot would ask if they would like to book a room
4) also bot would be a bit more friendly - asking them questions like if they are visiting for work or pleasure. things like if they like to book now I'd offer them a free welcome basket etc. 
5) visitor can book a room by selecting dates in calendar or just talking to voice agent. and so on

so basically this is the combination of:
- Voice + live transcription (accessibility + clarity)
- Contextual media (images, room tours, slideshows triggered by what's being discussed)
- Conversational booking with a calendar fallback
- Personalization ("work or pleasure", upselling a welcome basket)
